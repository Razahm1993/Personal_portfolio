          <p>
            I have recently started to learn python programming on a Udemy
            course and have recently completed a beginners coding bootcamp with
            the training providers QA. I have found it very interesting and
            would like to gain further knowledge to become a successful Software
            developer. There is currently a very high demand for Software
            developers and a skilled shortage. This demand is only increase,
            therefore leading to more opportunities. Corporate companies are
            looking to take and advantage of the technical advancements and
            upgrade operating systems. As there is a continuous increase in
            demand and a skill shortage, this will allow me to experience
            different projects in various sectors.

            I have self-taught IT skills as I was lucky to learn from real-life
            experiences. In my free time, I currently look after all
            computerized machines in two manufacturing companies. I regularly
            carry out services to all the machines and office equipment. I am on
            call to repair any issues. I have learned how to read electrical
            diagrams and am able to follow electrical installation instructions.
            I have also trained users to use machinery and software. I believe
            my communication skills are also at a very good standard as I have
            utilized these within Iress to speak to users but also to speak to
            manufacturers all around the world to get the issue resolved. I
            understand movement technology so I have enrolled on coding boot
            camp in the evening and attending the University of Birmingham to
            learn software skills.
